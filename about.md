# About Me

Hello! I'm Antonio Squicciarini, a PhD candidate in Engineering with a growing passion for machine learning and data-driven technologies.

I was born in the beautiful town of **Matera**, in southern Italy, where I completed all my early education up to high school at *Liceo Scientifico Dante Alighieri*. My academic journey took shape at the **Politecnico di Torino**, where I pursued both my **Bachelor's and Master‚Äôs degrees in Mechanical Engineering**. 

During my final year, I had the opportunity to study abroad at **E.T.S.I. Industriales, Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM)**, which significantly enriched my education and perspective. It was here, while working on my master‚Äôs thesis, that I first encountered the field of **machine learning**‚Äîan area that immediately captivated me with its potential and complexity.

After graduation, I joined UPM as a **postgraduate researcher**, where I deepened my focus on data analysis and algorithm development. This experience laid the groundwork for my current **PhD project**, which blends **information theory, signal processing, and machine learning** to develop innovative anomaly detection techniques. My PhD is now approaching its final phase, and I continue to be driven by curiosity and interdisciplinary challenges.
