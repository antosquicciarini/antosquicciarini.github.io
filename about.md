## My History

Hello! I'm Antonio Squicciarini, a PhD candidate in Engineering with a growing passion for machine learning and data-driven technologies.

I was born in the beautiful town of **Matera**, in southern Italy, where I completed my early education at *Liceo Scientifico Dante Alighieri*. I then moved to northern Italy to study at the **Politecnico di Torino**, where I earned both my **Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs degrees in Mechanical Engineering**.

During the final year of my Master's, I had the opportunity to study abroad at **E.T.S.I. Industriales, Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid (UPM)**. While developing my thesis on fault detection in rotating machinery, I was introduced to machine learning and deep learning‚Äîan experience that sparked a growing interest in data science.

After graduation, I joined UPM as a postgraduate researcher, where I focused on deep learning theory and its application to fault classification. My work involved the detection of partial discharges in AC and DC electrical grids. This research experience laid the groundwork for my current **PhD project**, which sits at the intersection of **information theory, signal processing, and machine learning**. My work aims to design novel entropic and information divergences to improve both feature extraction and optimization techniques, with applications in time series anomaly detection. I also address fundamental challenges such as class imbalance and label noise in supervised classification settings.

In **2024**, I had the opportunity to spend a semester abroad at **Cornell Tech** in Manhattan, joining the **S.A.B.Lab**, a research group focused on **medical image analysis** and **deep learning theory**. This international experience broadened my research perspective and deepened my commitment to contributing meaningfully to the field of machine learning.

Now entering the final phase of my PhD, I am excited to take on new challenges and explore future opportunities in both research and applied domains.

## Language Skills

Over the years, I‚Äôve developed strong communication skills in multiple languages. I‚Äôm **fluent in both English and Spanish**‚Äîhaving spent recent years working in Spain, where Spanish was the main language in daily life, while English remained predominant in scientific publications, events, and during my semester abroad in **New York City**. Currently, I‚Äôm also learning **French**, though I‚Äôm still at the beginning stage.

## Computer and Technical Skills

My main programming language is **Python**, which I use extensively for data analysis, deep learning, and research prototyping. I also have solid experience with **MATLAB**, developed during various engineering projects throughout my bachelor's and master‚Äôs studies, where I also learned **C** programming.

In terms of engineering software, I have completed projects using **SolidWorks**, **Automation Studio**, **NX Siemens**, **FlexSim**, and **Ansys Mechanical**. For documentation and academic writing, I frequently use **LaTeX**. My workflow often involves tools such as **Jupyter Notebooks**, **GitHub**, and **Google Cloud Platform**.

## Interests and Hobbies

Beyond research, I enjoy staying active‚Äîparticularly through hiking ü•æ and regular workouts at the gym üí™. I am passionate about language learning üó£Ô∏è. I also enjoy listening to podcasts üéß, especially those that cover public policy and the latest scientific discoveries üî¨. Reading üìö and traveling üåç are long-standing personal passions that keep me curious and open to new ideas.

## A Few More Things About Me

Teamwork and leadership have always played an important role in my personal development. I was an active member of the **CNGEI Scout Group** in Matera during high school, and served as my school‚Äôs **student representative** for two consecutive years.

During my bachelor's studies, I was part of the [**PoliTo Sailing Team**](https://sailingteam.polito.it/), a student-led group focused on designing competitive sailboats. I belonged to the dynamics subgroup, working on performance prediction models based on aerodynamic data from the design team.

In 2018, I participated at **Explorer Module of the School of Entrepreneurship and Innovation (SEI)**, supported by **Fondazione Agnelli**. I also participated in the **"Percorso per Giovani Talenti"**, a program for top-performing students at Politecnico di Torino between 2015 and 2018.
