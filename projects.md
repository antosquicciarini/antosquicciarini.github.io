# Projects

Welcome to my portfolio of selected research and engineering projects. My work spans machine learning applications, deep learning optimization, time-series analysis, signal processing, and real-world diagnostics in high-voltage systems and mechanical components. Below you'll find detailed descriptions of my key contributions, including methodologies, visuals, and links to related publications.

## [Multiscale Time-Series Feature Extraction Using Entropic & Informational Functionals](projects/seizure_detection)
We developed a multiscale feature extraction methodology for time series using adaptive kernel density estimation and a library of entropic and informational measures, enabling interpretable anomaly detection and time-series characterization across various domains like fault monitoring and EEG analysis.

## [Jensen-Tsallis Divergence for Supervised Classification under Data Imbalance](projects/jtd_cost_function)
We propose the Jensen-Tsallis Divergence (JTD) as a novel loss function for deep learning on imbalanced datasets, offering tunable regularization to improve generalization and outperforming traditional methods like cross-entropy, JSD, and focal loss.

## [Rub Detection in Aeroderivative Gas Turbines](projects/rub_detection)
We developed an intelligent fault detection system for early rub detection in aero-derivative gas turbines by training deep neural networks on synthetic vibration data from finite element simulations, achieving successful transfer learning to real experimental signals.

## [Partial Discharge Detection](projects/pd_classifications)
We developed a partial discharge classification system for high-voltage DC environments using deep learning, combining PRPD-inspired preprocessing, phase-robust data augmentation, and model interpretability through Integrated Gradients.
