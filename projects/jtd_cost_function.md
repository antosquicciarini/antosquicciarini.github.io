In many real-world classification problems—such as in healthcare, fraud detection, or predictive maintenance—data imbalance is a major challenge. Conventional loss functions like **Categorical Cross Entropy (CE)** can lead to models that overfit to majority classes and produce **overconfident predictions** that fail to generalize.

In this work, we propose the **Jensen-Tsallis Divergence (JTD)** as a **new loss function** for deep learning models trained on imbalanced datasets. It generalizes the well-known **Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD)** by incorporating **Tsallis entropy**, introducing a tunable parameter `q` that directly influences regularization strength.

## Why Jensen-Tsallis?

- **Built-in regularization**: JTD discourages overconfident output distributions, leading to better generalization.
- **Tunable flexibility**: The `q` parameter controls how strongly the model penalizes high-confidence predictions.
- **Superior performance**: JTD consistently outperforms CE, JSD, and focal loss in tests with artificially imbalanced datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, Fashion-MNIST).

## Theoretical Insight

We demonstrate that JTD introduces an intrinsic **confidence penalty** on output predictions. By adjusting `q`, we control how conservative the model becomes, thus reducing overfitting.
