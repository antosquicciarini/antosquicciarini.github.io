This project proposes a general-purpose methodology to transform time series into interpretable sequences of **entropic and information-theoretic features**. The method is designed for **anomaly detection** and **time-series characterization** in domains such as fault monitoring, EEG seizure detection, and more.

The approach combines:
- **Multiscale overlapping windows**
- **Non-parametric Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**
- **Adaptive bandwidth optimization using Jensen‚ÄìShannon Divergence (JSD)**
- **A library of continuous entropic and informational measures** (e.g., Shannon, Tsallis, R√©nyi, Fisher Information)

## üß† Why This Matters

Entropy and information measures provide a **rich, continuous description of signal complexity**, uncertainty, and structure ‚Äî essential for detecting subtle or time-localized anomalies. Our method optimizes the transformation parameters and builds a **scale-adaptive, windowed representation** of the signal.

## üìê Method Overview

The methodology applies **KDE** to windowed segments of the time series at multiple scales, producing a sequence of PDFs. Then, various **entropy-based features** are computed for each PDF. The bandwidth is optimized offline using **JSD**, ensuring minimal bias and variance.

## üî¨ Experimental Results

## üß™ Synthetic Signal with Contextual Anomaly

We generate a synthetic signal that transitions from a normal to an anomalous regime using added frequency components. The anomaly is detected by shifts in entropy and information content.

## üéØ Multiscale Feature Plots

We visualize the extracted features across different window sizes and time indices.

## üß† Real Application: EEG Seizure Detection

The methodology was applied to **scalp EEG signals** from the CHB-MIT database. The results show that seizures trigger consistent, multi-scale changes in the extracted features.

## üìà Final Validation

To ensure interpretability, we also plotted the PDFs generated at different scales and bandwidths to visualize how KDE transforms signal windows before entropy evaluation.
